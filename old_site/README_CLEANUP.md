## QUICK DECISION GUIDE

**The old_site folder is "a hot mess" with 95% Google Sites bloat. Here's what's actually useful:**

### 🎯 Keep & Preserve (Option B Recommended)
- **7 student research datasets** with full codebooks (1,342 to 397 responses each)
- **10+ Excel teaching templates** (Logistic Regression, Conjoint, Pricing, etc.)
- **Practice datasets** for statistics education

### 🗑️ Delete Safely  
- All 5 Google Sites HTML pages (redundant + bloated)
- Google's CSS and JS framework files
- Tracking/telemetry markup

### ⚡ Action Items
1. Decide: Keep Option B (migrate resources) or Option A (delete all)?
2. If Option B: Check what files exist in `old_site/Excel Sheets/` and `old_site/Previous Student Projects/`
3. Create clean replacement page linking to preserved resources
