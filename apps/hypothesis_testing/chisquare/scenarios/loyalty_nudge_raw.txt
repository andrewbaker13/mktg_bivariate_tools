# Title
Loyalty SMS Nudge by Subsequent Action (Raw Dataset)

# Description
<p>
Customer marketing is testing follow-up SMS nudges to three loyalty segments to see how members respond after their latest purchase. The segments are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enrolled Member:</strong> shoppers who have joined the loyalty program but show light engagement.</li>
  <li><strong>In-Store Fan:</strong> frequent store visitors who occasionally shop online but prefer physical locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital App User:</strong> highly active app users who regularly browse and buy through the mobile experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each member received a standardized SMS nudge with a link to a personalized offer. Their follow-up behavior is recorded as one of three outcomes: <strong>Coupon</strong> redeemed, <strong>Visit</strong> (web/app visit without immediate coupon redemption), or <strong>None</strong> (no measurable action). The raw rows below provide a realistic mix of responses: some segments over-index on coupon redemptions, others show more “soft” visits, and every segment has a non-trivial share of members who ignore the nudge.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a chi-square test of independence on the contingency table implied by this raw dataset to evaluate whether subsequent behavior is associated with loyalty segment. Rather than treating the SMS as uniformly effective (or ineffective), the test helps you understand whether different segment behaviors suggest segment-specific creative, offer structures, or follow-up cadences.
