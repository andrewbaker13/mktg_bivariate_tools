# Title
Character Class vs Dungeon Survival Rate

# Description
<p>
After completing one hundred dungeon encounters across various campaigns, your Dungeon Master compiled survival data by character class. The party has noticed an apparent pattern: barbarians seem to walk out of dangerous situations relatively unscathed, while wizards are frequently making death saving throws or rolling up new character sheets.
</p>
<p>
The anecdotal evidence is compelling, but you want to move beyond "it feels like wizards die more often" to a statistical statement about whether character class is truly associated with survival outcomes. Two classes are compared:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Barbarians:</strong> High hit points, damage resistance while raging, and generally built to absorb damage.</li>
  <li><strong>Wizards:</strong> Low hit points, physically fragile, but powerful spellcasting abilities that can control the battlefield if they survive long enough to cast.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The data shows a clear difference in survival rates: 45 out of 50 barbarians survived their encounters (90% survival), while only 30 out of 50 wizards made it through (60% survival). The question is whether this difference is statistically significant or could have occurred by chance given the randomness inherent in dice-based combat.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a chi-square test of independence to determine whether character class and survival outcome are associated. The results will help your party make informed decisions about party composition for high-risk dungeons—should you bring more tanks to protect the squishy spellcasters, or is the survival difference within the realm of random variation?
