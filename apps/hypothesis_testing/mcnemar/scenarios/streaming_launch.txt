# Title
Streaming Launch Creative Test

# Description
A streaming platform is rolling out a flagship sci-fi series. The lifecycle team randomized 2,400 loyalists into two experiences: an action-heavy trailer (Condition A) and a mystery-driven trailer (Condition B). After a week, every viewer was pinged again with the alternate spot.

Each record below represents a subscriber twice—once for the first trailer they saw and again after seeing the alternate spot. A “positive” outcome means the subscriber added the series to their watchlist within 48 hours of the exposure.
