# Title
B2B Nurture Content Tracks

# Description
<p>
A SaaS demand-generation team is trying to resurrect a pool of dormant enterprise leads. Historically, they’ve relied on a technical, product-spec drip campaign that highlights features, integrations, and roadmap bullets. The new team lead believes that a more <strong>insight-led nurture track</strong>—case studies, benchmarks, and executive POV content—will do a better job of pushing fence-sitters into qualified pipeline.
</p>
<p>
To test this, the team builds two storytelling arcs and runs them as a crossover experiment for the same group of accounts over six weeks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tutorial Deep Dive (Condition A):</strong> hands-on walkthroughs of product capabilities, integration patterns, and technical FAQs.</li>
  <li><strong>Executive ROI Story (Condition B):</strong> narrative emails that focus on business outcomes, payback periods, and peer benchmarks for senior buyers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each participating lead is observed twice: once after the technical track and once after the executive track. For each exposure, sales ops records whether the lead progressed to a <strong>qualified pipeline opportunity</strong> (yes/no). That structure—paired observations on the same leads with a binary outcome—makes this a classic use case for <strong>McNemar’s test</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The counts below are realistic: many leads are “no pipeline” under both tracks, some convert under both, and a non-trivial number flip from no→yes or yes→no between conditions. Your analytical goal is to focus on the <em>discordant pairs</em> (Tutorial yes/Executive no vs. Tutorial no/Executive yes) to assess whether the executive storyline meaningfully improves the chance of reaching qualified pipeline, or whether the apparent differences could reasonably be attributed to noise.
