# Title
Retail Promotions Pricing Test

# Description
<p>
A national retailer is piloting a smart-pricing endcap that can dynamically personalize promotional messaging. Store operations wants to know whether this new <strong>adaptive signage</strong> actually changes shopper behavior compared with the long-standing legacy bundle signage.
</p>
<p>
In the pilot, every participating store runs both approaches on consecutive weekends, rotating which weekend gets which treatment:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legacy signage (Condition A):</strong> static bundle sign with a simple discount message and SKU list.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptive signage (Condition B):</strong> AI-powered sign that personalizes the headline (e.g., “Save more on your usual basket”) based on local purchase patterns and time of day.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each household loyalty ID that visits during the test is effectively observed twice: once under the legacy signage weekend and once under the adaptive signage weekend. For each visit, analysts record whether the shopper <strong>purchased the featured bundle</strong> at least once (yes/no). This paired, binary outcome structure is ideal for <strong>McNemar’s test</strong>, which focuses on shoppers who “change their mind” between conditions.
</p>
<p>
The counts below reflect a realistic lift: many households ignore the bundle both weekends, some buy it under both, and a noticeable number flip from no→yes or yes→no when signage changes. Your analytical task is to compare the discordant cells (Legacy yes / Adaptive no vs. Legacy no / Adaptive yes) to decide whether adaptive signage is credibly increasing bundle purchases, and whether that lift is meaningful enough to justify rollout costs (hardware, creative operations, training).
