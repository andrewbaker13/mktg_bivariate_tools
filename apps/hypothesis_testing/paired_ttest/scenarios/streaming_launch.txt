# Title
Global Streaming Launch Creative Test

# Description
<p>
The brand studio is preparing a pitch deck for a multi-continent streaming bundle launch and needs to show how strongly its hero creative directions move both <strong>brand recall</strong> and <strong>conversion</strong> for the same local markets. Rather than running separate tests, the team captured two views on every designated market area (DMA).
</p>
<p>
For each DMA, analysts collected:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Studio Recall:</strong> unaided recall of the hero storyline from a quick panel pulse in that DMA.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth Conversion:</strong> incremental household conversions attributed to the promo bundle offer in that same DMA, scaled onto a comparable 0–60 index.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because both metrics live on similar scales and are measured for the same set of DMAs, each row below is a <em>paired observation</em> (recall score vs. conversion score). Creative leads want to know whether a DMA that “remembers the story” also tends to “show up in conversions,” or whether performance-only creative would be a better bet.
</p>
<p>
The differences in the table (conversion minus recall) are realistic: most DMAs show slightly higher conversion than recall, but not by the same amount; a few markets lag or over-deliver. Your analytical goal is to use a <strong>paired t-test</strong> on these recall vs. conversion scores to determine whether, on average, growth conversion meaningfully exceeds recall, and to translate that into a story about which creative strategy to lead with in the global roll-out.
