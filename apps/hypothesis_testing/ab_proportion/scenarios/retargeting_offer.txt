# Title
Retargeting Offer Test

# Description
<p>
The <strong>Paid Media</strong> team is optimizing a retargeting program for visitors who viewed a product page but did not convert. Creative leads want to know whether a simple, price-forward message is enough, or if a more complex limited-time bundle offer will drive a higher conversion rate without confusing people.
</p>
<p>
You design an experiment that rotates two display creatives into the same remarketing pool:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price Anchor Banner (Control):</strong> highlights the core subscription price with a clear "From $29/month" anchor and a single "Get started" CTA.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonus Bundle Banner (Variant):</strong> advertises a limited-time bundle that includes an add-on feature and a short-term discount, plus a small countdown treatment to emphasize urgency.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both creatives click through to the same landing page and onboarding flow. Over ten days, matched audiences see several impressions each; you record the proportion of unique exposed users who complete sign-up after seeing each creative. The observed conversion rates differ modestly: the bundle offer has a somewhat higher conversion proportion, but not by an eye-popping amount, and sample sizes are in the hundreds rather than tens of thousands.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a two-proportion test to evaluate whether the bonus bundle's higher conversion rate is likely to reflect a real underlying lift or a random fluctuation. You will translate the estimated percentage point difference into additional sign-ups and revenue, and weigh that against the operational and creative costs of maintaining a more complex, time-sensitive offer.
