# Title
Full-Funnel KPI Matrix

# Description
<p>
A growth analytics pod has collected 12 weeks of data for four KPIs: <strong>paid media spend</strong> (in $K), <strong>aided awareness</strong> (%), <strong>consideration</strong> (%), and <strong>free-trial conversions</strong>. Each row below represents one week’s performance across the full funnel.
</p>
<p>
Strategists want to understand how these metrics move together before they lock the next quarter’s budget. They suspect that spend, awareness, and consideration are positively related to conversions, but they also know that creative quality, competitive activity, and seasonality introduce noise. They do <em>not</em> expect any single KPI to perfectly predict the others.
</p>
<p>
The matrix shows a realistic pattern: as spend increases, awareness and consideration tend to rise, and conversions generally follow—but with week-to-week bumps and dips that keep the relationships moderate rather than near-perfect. This allows students to practice reading and interpreting correlation matrices that contain a mix of stronger and weaker associations.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to compute and interpret the <strong>Pearson correlation matrix</strong> for these four variables. Which KPI pairs have the strongest linear relationships? Where are the links weaker or potentially non-linear? From a marketing perspective, you will use those patterns to tell a story about how upper-funnel attention relates to mid-funnel intent and ultimately to trial volume, while being careful not to overstate what correlation can and cannot prove.
