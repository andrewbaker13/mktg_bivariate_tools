# Title
Paid Social Spend vs Trial Signups

# Description
A commerce team piloted an always-on paid social program in 10 metro areas. Spend reflects weekly media investment (in $K) while signups captures the number of free-trial registrations during the same week.

Leads asked whether diminishing returns have already kicked in or if they can safely double the program next month.
