# Title
Awareness vs Consideration — Q3 Brand Tracker

# Description
Your Q3 tracker asked 10k panelists to rate unprompted awareness and likelihood to consider the brand on a 0-100 scale. Each row aggregates one key market.

Insights showed that creative bursts in the West drove top-of-funnel lift but the Northeast underperformed on consideration, so the team wants to inspect the correlation before budgeting Q4 PR.
