# Title
Loyalty Retention vs Net Promoter Score

# Description
<p>
Your customer success team has benchmarked a set of strategic accounts in the loyalty program. For each account, you have two metrics: <strong>retention rate</strong> (the percentage of members who renewed or stayed active over the last year) and the most recent <strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong> from a relationship survey.
</p>
<p>
Leadership often claims that “happy members stay longer,” but they want to see evidence that NPS and retention actually move together across accounts. At the same time, analysts know that retention depends on other forces—pricing changes, product fit, contract terms—so they expect a correlation that is meaningful but far from perfect.
</p>
<p>
The table below shows a realistic pattern: accounts with higher NPS generally have higher retention, but there is overlap and a couple of accounts that over- or under-perform relative to the trend. This gives students practice interpreting correlations that are clearly positive yet still noisy.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to compute the <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> between NPS and retention across accounts, and then interpret both its magnitude and statistical significance. From a marketing and CX perspective, you will use that summary to decide whether investments in member experience (e.g., service training, surprise-and-delight perks) appear to be tightly linked to reduced churn, or whether retention is only loosely tied to survey sentiment.
