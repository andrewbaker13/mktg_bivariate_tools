# Title
Streaming Hours Cohort Experiment

# Description
Two streaming cohorts were tracked for a retention sprint. “Monthly Pass Holders” are always-on subscribers, while “Seasonal Bingers” only reactivate around marquee releases. Product marketing wants to know whether the heavier users truly stream more hours per week before green-lighting a loyalty push.

This scenario demonstrates the raw-data upload mode. Each row below is one user’s weekly Hours_Streaming observation, so the tool must summarize the observations before running Welch’s t-test.
