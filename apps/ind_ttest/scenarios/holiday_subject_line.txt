# Title
Holiday Subject Line Lift

# Description
<p>
Your ecommerce brand is planning its peak holiday campaign. The CRM team is debating whether it is worth investing extra creative time in a more polished, benefit-led subject line versus reusing the simple control line that has performed �??okay�?? in the past.
</p>
<p>
To answer this, you run an A/B test at scale. Half of the active email list receives a plain-English subject line similar to last year��s control. The other half receives an <strong>optimized holiday subject line</strong> that calls out savings, free shipping, and curated gift ideas in a tighter way. Nothing else in the email changes; copy and layout below the fold are held constant.
</p>
<p>
For each group, you compute <strong>revenue per delivered email</strong> over the full holiday window. The means differ by a few dollars per recipient, and the standard deviations are fairly large. That pattern is typical in real email programs: lots of noisy behavior at the individual level, but potentially meaningful average lift once you aggregate across the entire list.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use an independent-samples t-test to quantify whether the optimized subject line produces a <em>statistically credible</em> and <em>managerially relevant</em> increase in revenue per recipient. You��ll translate the estimated mean difference into projected incremental holiday revenue and decide whether it justifies the extra creative and QA effort.
