# Title
Holiday Subject Line Lift

# Description
The brand is rolling out its annual holiday email stretch and wants to know if a curated, benefits-focused subject line can push average revenue per recipient higher than the plain-English control.
This preset gives you average dollars per recipient, variability, and sample size for each version so you can translate a mean difference into estimated incremental holiday revenue before the hero subject line is locked in.
