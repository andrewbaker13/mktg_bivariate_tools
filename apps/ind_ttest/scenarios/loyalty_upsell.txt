# Title
Loyalty Upsell Experiment

# Description
Marketing wants to know if loyalty members spend more when the email copy highlights a personalized reward vs. a generic loyalty update.
This preset gives you per-recipient spend, variability, and sample size so you can decide whether the observed lift is large and stable enough to support a full loyalty-program rollout.
