# Title
Refer-a-Friend Revenue Pilot

# Description
The product team is testing a refer-a-friend incentive versus the historic control to see how much incremental downstream revenue each recipient generates.
This preset gives you average revenue per recipient, variability, and sample sizes so you can translate a mean difference into projected incremental revenue before deciding whether to scale the incentive.
