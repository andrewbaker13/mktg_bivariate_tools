# Title
Warrior vs Rogue Damage Output

# Description
<p>
Your adventuring party is in the middle of a heated tavern debate: do warriors or rogues deal more damage per round in combat? The fighter insists that raw strength and reliable weapon strikes give warriors the edge, while the rogue argues that sneak attacks and precision targeting create superior damage output.
</p>
<p>
To settle the argument with data instead of ale-fueled speculation, your party's chronicler tracked damage per attack over the last twenty encounters for both classes. Each warrior attack and each rogue attack was recorded, including critical hits, misses that still dealt partial damage, and everything in between.
</p>
<p>
The results show that rogues have a slightly higher mean damage per attack, but they also exhibit greater variability—some attacks land devastating sneak attacks while others miss the mark entirely. Warriors, by contrast, show more consistent damage output with lower variance, reflecting their steady, reliable combat style.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use an independent-samples t-test (specifically Welch's t-test, which accounts for unequal variances) to determine whether rogues <em>significantly</em> outdamage warriors, or whether the observed difference could simply be due to the random variation of dice rolls and combat circumstances. The test will help your party understand if class selection meaningfully impacts damage output, or if both classes are roughly equivalent in this regard.
