Likert Scale Feedback vs. Brand Rating

# Description
A brand team has collected survey data where 50 customers rated a new product concept on a 1-to-5 Likert scale ("Strongly Dislike" to "Strongly Like") and also provided an overall brand rating on a 0-100 scale.

This dataset is ideal for testing the tool's ability to handle a numeric predictor with few unique values.

Use this preset to toggle the "Predictor type" between "Continuous" and "Categorical". Observe how the model interpretation, visuals, and statistical outputs change when treating the Likert scale as a linear trend versus a set of distinct groups. This is a common analytical choice with significant implications for how results are reported.
