# Title
Paid Social Spend vs. Weekly Revenue

# Description
<p>
You are the performance marketing lead for a mid-sized direct-to-consumer brand that relies heavily on paid social platforms (Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube) to drive traffic to the site. Over the last two years, the team has tracked weekly <strong>paid social spend</strong> alongside <strong>total site revenue</strong> for each week.
</p>
<p>
Leaders keep asking a familiar question: <em>“If we add budget to paid social next month, what kind of lift in revenue should we realistically expect?”</em> Past conversations have bounced between optimistic anecdotes (remembering a few “hero” weeks) and pessimistic ones (weeks where revenue barely moved). To move the discussion beyond anecdotes, you decide to fit a bivariate regression model of <strong>Weekly Revenue</strong> (outcome) on <strong>Weekly Paid Social Spend</strong> (predictor).
</p>
<p>
The data are intentionally noisy and realistic: some weeks with similar spend produce very different revenue, and a few weeks have strong performance despite moderate spend. This better reflects real-world digital campaigns where creative fatigue, seasonality, and overlapping promotions can all influence outcomes alongside budget.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to estimate a <strong>practical marginal effect</strong> of spend on revenue and quantify the uncertainty around that estimate. Rather than searching for a “perfect” prediction, you want to communicate a sensible range: for example, a typical incremental revenue per \$1 of spend, with confidence intervals that acknowledge the noise in the data.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fit the regression:</strong> Treat weekly paid social spend as the predictor (X) and weekly revenue as the outcome (Y). Inspect the slope as an estimate of incremental revenue per dollar spent.</li>
  <li><strong>Examine confidence intervals:</strong> Use the CI around the slope to describe a realistic band of outcomes, not a single point estimate.</li>
  <li><strong>Check R-squared and residuals:</strong> Use them to explain why budget is a meaningful driver but not the <em>only</em> driver of revenue.</li>
  <li><strong>Translate to planning language:</strong> Reframe the results as a range of likely revenue outcomes for a proposed budget change, highlighting both upside and risk.</li>
</ul>
