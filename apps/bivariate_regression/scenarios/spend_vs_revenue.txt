# Title
Weekly Ad Spend vs. Revenue

# Description
A direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand's performance marketing team wants to understand the return on their paid media investment. They have compiled 200 weeks of data, recording the total ad spend and the total revenue generated for each week.

The goal is to build a simple model to answer a fundamental question: "For every additional dollar we spend on ads, how much additional revenue can we expect to generate?"

# How to use
<strong>Interpret the Slope:</strong> The slope of the regression line represents the estimated return on ad spend (ROAS). A slope of 2.5, for example, suggests that each additional dollar of ad spend is associated with $2.50 in additional revenue.
<strong>Check the R-squared:</strong> This value tells you what percentage of the variation in weekly revenue is explained by ad spend alone. A low R-squared suggests that other factors (seasonality, promotions, etc.) are also major drivers of revenue.
<strong>Examine Outliers:</strong> Look for weeks where the data point is far from the fitted line. These represent unusually high or low performing weeks that may warrant further investigation.
