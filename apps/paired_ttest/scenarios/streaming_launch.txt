# Title
Global Streaming Launch Creative Test

# Description
The brand studio is polishing the pitch deck for a multi-continent streaming bundle launch and needs to prove each creative direction changes the same marketing KPI in a meaningful way. Instead of running a simple before/after holdout, the team gathered two simultaneous views on every designated market area (DMA):
- **Studio Recall** — unaided recall of the hero storyline measured via a quick panel pulse in each DMA.
- **Growth Conversion** — incremental household conversions attributed to the promo bundle offer in that same DMA.

Because both metrics sit on a comparable 0–60 scale, each DMA yields a paired observation (recall score vs. conversion score). Stakeholders now want to know whether the cinematic storytelling that boosts recall also translates into comparable conversion momentum, or whether the promo-heavy creative is the only lever that moves deals.

How to use:
- Check whether the paired difference (conversion − recall) is consistently positive or if certain DMAs drag the mean toward zero.
- Toggle confidence levels to illustrate how sensitive the conclusion is for CMOs focused on awareness vs. CROs focused on revenue.
- Use the histogram and diagnostics to call out DMAs where the two measures diverge sharply so that field teams can investigate local context.
