# Title
Retail Promotions Pricing Test

# Description
A nationwide retailer alternated its loyalty pricing banners between a shouty “Compare & Save” frame and a friendlier “Bundle Rewards” promise. Twenty matched stores rotated the messaging over four weeks while holding merchandising, regional offers, and staffing constant. The merchandising analytics pod captured per-basket lift (Bundle Rewards minus legacy) for every store and asked whether the softer framing nudged shoppers toward bigger baskets without increasing discount depth.

The difference scores below represent incremental dollars per basket when Bundle Rewards banners ran. Use the preset to:
- Experiment with stricter or looser α levels before socializing results with merchandising and CX partners.
- Inspect the histogram for regional skew—several Sun Belt locations initially under-performed until signage was localized.
- Borrow the managerial summary as a recap for the Monday pricing huddle, alongside a note about stores whose lift fell inside the confidence interval.
