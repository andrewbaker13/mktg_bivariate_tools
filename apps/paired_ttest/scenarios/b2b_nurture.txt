# Title
B2B Nurture Content Tracks

# Description
A conversion marketing squad wants to know whether its new insight-led nurture series outperforms the long-standing product-spec drip. Both tracks were served to the same 34 in-market accounts (two-week washout between flights), and the analyst had time to summarize only the change in marketing-qualified opportunities per account before the CMO review.

The summary stats below capture the mean and standard deviation of the paired differences (insights track − legacy track) plus the number of sampled accounts. Use the preset to:
- Confirm whether the uplift still clears the bar when α is tightened to 0.025 for the finance gate.
- Stress-test the effect size by editing the SD upward—sales ops warned that a few accounts experienced wild week-to-week swings.
- Copy the APA and managerial blurbs into the nurture optimization deck so stakeholders see both the statistical verdict and the business framing.
