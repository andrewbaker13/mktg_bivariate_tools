          This lab focuses on questions like: <em>"If I draw a sample of size \(n\) from a population of size \(N\),
          what is the chance that a particular set of \(r\) special items appears in my sample?"</em>. You can toggle
          between sampling <strong>without replacement</strong> (hypergeometric) and <strong>with replacement</strong>
          (binomial-style) frameworks.

        <details class="intro-notes">
          <summary>Key ideas illustrated</summary>
          <p><strong>Hypergeometric model (without replacement):</strong> draws from a finite population where each
            individual can only be selected once. The number of special items in the sample follows a hypergeometric
            distribution.</p>
          <p><strong>Binomial model (with replacement):</strong> repeated independent draws with the same probability of
            selecting a special item on each draw. The number of special items in the sample follows a binomial
            distribution.</p>
          <p><strong>"At least one" logic:</strong> the probability of seeing at least one special item is computed via
            the complement: \(P(\text{at least one}) = 1 - P(\text{zero specials})\). The app shows this computation
            numerically and symbolically.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Population size \(N\):</strong> think of this as the full list of customers, items, or units you could sample from.
            In many marketing problems \(N\) is large but finite (panel members, current customers, emails on a list).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sample size \(n\):</strong> how many draws you make. For <em>without replacement</em>, this cannot exceed \(N\);
            for <em>with replacement</em> you can think of re-contacting or re-targeting with possible repeats.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Special items \(r\):</strong> a fixed set you care about (VIP customers, high-value prospects, defective units).
            The model assumes these are known in advance and fixed inside the population.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Target count \(k\):</strong> used for \(P(K = k)\). For example, \(k = 0\) is the probability you miss all specials;
            \(k = 2\) is the chance you get exactly two specials in the sample.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sampling mode:</strong> choose <em>without replacement</em> for one-off samples from a list,
            and <em>with replacement</em> for repeated, independent trials (like ad impressions) where the same unit could be sampled multiple times.

          <summary>Understanding the \(\binom{n}{k}\) notation</summary>
          <p>
            In the equations below you will see expressions written as \(\binom{n}{k}\) or \(\binom{N}{n}\). This is read
            out loud as “<em>n choose k</em>” and it counts how many different groups of \(k\) items you can form from a
            larger pool of \(n\) items when order does not matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if there are \(n = 10\) customers and you want to know how many different samples of size \(k = 3\)
            you could draw, \(\binom{10}{3} = 120\). That means there are 120 distinct 3‑person groups you might see.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mathematically, \(\binom{n}{k}\) is computed as
            \[
              \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!},
            \]
            where \(n!\) (“<em>n factorial</em>”) means \(n \times (n-1) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1\). In practice, the
            app uses a more numerically stable version of this calculation, but the idea is the same: it is counting how many
            ways you can choose positions for the “special” outcomes inside the sample.

            <strong>k (number of specials):</strong> each row corresponds to a specific value of \(k\), the number of times the
            chosen outcome (your "special" label) occurs in the sample. The example row highlighted here corresponds to
            \(k =\) <span id="table-example-k">2</span>, meaning exactly that many specials are observed in the sample.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Theoretical P(K = k):</strong> this column shows the exact probability that a random sample will contain
            exactly \(k\) specials, computed from the hypergeometric or binomial model. In your current table, the example row
            has theoretical probability <span id="table-example-theoretical">0.1800</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Simulated frequency:</strong> after you run simulations, this column counts how many of those simulated
            samples produced each value of \(k\). For the example row, the table shows
            <span id="table-example-frequency">360</span> out of
            <span id="table-example-total">2,000</span> simulated samples landing on that value of \(k\).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Simulated P(K = k):</strong> this is the simulated frequency divided by the total number of simulations.
            In your current table, the example row has simulated probability
            <span id="table-example-simprob">0.1800</span>, which should be close to the theoretical value if you have run
            enough simulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cumulative P(K &le; k):</strong> this column adds up the theoretical probabilities from 0 up through that row’s
            value of \(k\). If the cumulative value in the row for \(k = 2\) is 0.6500, you can read that as “there is a 65%
            chance of seeing at most two specials in the sample.”
