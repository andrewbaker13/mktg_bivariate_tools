"The new enrollment system is honestly awesome compared to the old nightmare portal; it actually feels very modern now and I'm not constantly worried it will crash mid-click."
"I tried to add one class and the site froze three times in a row; it isn't just slow, it's genuinely terrible when you're already stressed about getting the last open seat."
"It worked fine for me on Chrome, but my roommate keeps getting weird error messages on Safari, so I'm kind of unsure whether the system is really stable for everyone."
"Love how I can finally see my waitlist position in real time; that tiny change is very reassuring when you're desperately hoping the class opens up before the add/drop deadline."
"The interface looks pretty and is definitely cleaner, but it's still confusing where to drop a class without messing up my whole schedule, so I'm not totally confident using it yet."
"Honestly, I'm neutral about it right now; it feels different, not necessarily better or worse, and I'm still very unsure if it will handle peak traffic without major issues."
"Why would they push this live during peak enrollment week? The timing is awful and it kind of feels like they didn't fully test it before throwing thousands of students at it."
"Super smooth this morning: I logged in, clicked a few times, and I was completely done in five minutes, which is very impressive compared to the chaotic mess we had last semester."
"I hate that it logs you out so quickly; I stepped away for a second to check my degree plan and came back to find everything gone, which is really frustrating and not very user-friendly."
"The search filters are actually helpful now; I can filter by time and campus without losing my mind, and it's very nice not to scroll endlessly through irrelevant course options."
"It took forever to load on my phone, so I just gave up and used the old desktop lab; for something that's supposed to be convenient, it's not great on mobile at all."
"Not sure if it's the system or the Wi‑Fi, but pages keep timing out during checkout; it's really not cool when you're scared you'll lose your spot every time you click submit."
"The new layout is clean and easy to read, and I actually kind of enjoy browsing classes now; it's a big improvement over that 90s-looking screen we had before, which was just awful."
"I was on the waitlist for two classes and the notifications were totally unclear about what happened; it's very confusing to get an email that kind of hints at a change but doesn't say it plainly."
"This update feels rushed; there are so many small glitches that make it really frustrating to use, and I'm not convinced they fully thought through the student experience."
"Once I figured out the steps, it was actually pretty straightforward; the tutorial video was very helpful, and now I don't feel nearly as nervous navigating the process."
"No more random crashes so far, which is great, but I still don't quite trust it on the day enrollment opens because the stakes are so high and the old system was so horribly unreliable."
"Customer support was super responsive in chat when I couldn't drop a class; they were very friendly and walked me through the steps, which made the whole situation feel much less stressful."
"The color-coding for conflicts is nice and kind of clever, but the warning messages are still way too vague, so you have to guess what went wrong instead of clearly understanding the issue."
"Overall it's a mixed bag: better design and some very thoughtful features, but the underlying reliability still needs serious work before students will fully trust it."
