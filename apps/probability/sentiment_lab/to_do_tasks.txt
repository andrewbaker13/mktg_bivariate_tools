(1) I would like to make the "How VADER scored one example" actually TWO worked examples.  
    It should illsutrate how one of the scores in the highest +1 to +2sd was scored, 
    and one in the -1sd to -2sd range (this will hopefully be more illsutrative for the learner)

(2) Export the VADER scores columns as a CSV


(3) Check iof VADER is correctly implementing negation (ex: isn't good), 
attenuation (ex: kind of), and accentuation (ex: very) rules, VADER is supposed to do that, and the package
 we're using is supposed to be able to handle it, per the instructions on GitHub
