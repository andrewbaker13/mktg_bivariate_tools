Social CTA Refresh (Raw Dataset)

# Description
Social media managers are debating whether a static story CTA or a looping "reaction" CTA drives more swipe-up traffic to a limited campaign microsite. Team A keeps the evergreen static reminder. Team B introduces animated reaction badges plus a countdown timer over the swipe CTA. Paid traffic was split evenly across lookalike audiences for one day and the raw conversions are listed below.
