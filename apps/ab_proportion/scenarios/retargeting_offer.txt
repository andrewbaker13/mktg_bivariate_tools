# Title
Retargeting Offer Test

# Description
The **Paid Media** desk is running a retargeting split test between a price-forward banner and a limited-time bonus bundle across the same landing page. Control creatives lean into the **Price Anchor Banner** messaging, while the variant highlights the **Bonus Bundle** with countdown urgency. After ten days of matched audience exposure, the team is comparing conversions to tell whether higher perceived savings outweigh the increased complexity of the bundle.

Primary metric: click-to-conversion rate from retargeting impressions to completed sign-ups.
Decision focus: does the bonus bundle messaging create a lift large enough to justify the added offer complexity?
