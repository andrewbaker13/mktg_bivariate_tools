# Title
Channel Partner Loyalty Push

# Description
The **Partnership Marketing** crew is experimenting with a loyalty incentive in co-branded emails to **Channel Partner** lists. The control email reminds customers about standard loyalty benefits, while the variant highlights a new tiered bonus for partner purchases and a dedicated customer success hotline. Traffic flowed over seven days with matched small-business segments; now the analysts are studying whether the tiered approach nudges buyers beyond the usual reorder behavior.

Primary metric: email-to-purchase conversion rate on partner-branded loyalty emails.
Decision focus: should the team roll out the tiered loyalty bonus broadly across **Channel Partner** campaigns?
