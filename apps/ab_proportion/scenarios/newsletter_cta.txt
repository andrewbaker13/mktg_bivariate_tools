Newsletter CTA Optimization

# Description
<p>
The <strong>StudyFlow</strong> lifecycle squad is redesigning the weekly study-planning newsletter that goes out to more than 45,000 students. Historically, the email has used a friendly, low-pressure call-to-action: "Start your session". A new performance-focused marketer believes that a more urgent CTA "Claim your session now" will push more students into the product without hurting the relationship tone.
</p>
<p>
To test this, the team runs a two-week A/B experiment. Every eligible send is randomized into one of two conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Control:</strong> the existing, conversational CTA "Start your session" near the top of the email.</li>
  <li><strong>Urgency variant:</strong> a tighter CTA "Claim your session now", paired with a subtle time cue that nudges students to act before their next exam block.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The rest of the email content (subject line, hero image, and study tips) is held constant. For each arm, the team tracks <strong>click-to-start conversion rate</strong>: the proportion of delivered emails that lead to a completed study session within 24 hours. The observed rates differ by only a few percentage points, with realistic noise from week-to-week engagement and list churn.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a two-proportion z-test to quantify whether the urgency CTA produces a <em>statistically credible</em> lift in conversion, and to translate that lift into incremental weekly sessions. The decision question is straightforward: should the lifecycle team standardize on the urgency CTA for future newsletters, or treat the observed difference as too small or too uncertain to justify a tone shift?
