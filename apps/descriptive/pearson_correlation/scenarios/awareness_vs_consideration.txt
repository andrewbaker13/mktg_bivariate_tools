# Title
Awareness vs Consideration – Q3 Brand Tracker

# Description
<p>
Your Q3 brand tracker asked 10,000 panelists in multiple markets to rate <strong>unprompted awareness</strong> and <strong>likelihood to consider</strong> the brand on a 0–100 scale. The table below aggregates those results for a set of key markets, each row representing one market’s average scores.
</p>
<p>
Media planners believe that upper-funnel bursts (PR, social video, sponsorships) are doing a good job of lifting awareness, but they are less sure whether that awareness translates into meaningful <em>consideration</em>. In some markets, creative feels buzzy but lightweight; in others, messaging is more product- and value-focused. The team wants to quantify how tightly awareness and consideration move together before locking Q4 brand investments.
</p>
<p>
The pattern in the data is realistic: markets with higher awareness tend to have higher consideration, but the association is far from perfect. A few markets “over-deliver” on consideration relative to awareness, while others lag despite solid awareness scores. This is exactly the kind of noisy brand-tracking relationship analysts see in practice.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use the <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> between awareness and consideration to summarize how strongly these two stages of the funnel are linked across markets. You will interpret both the <em>size</em> of the correlation (weak, moderate, strong) and its <em>significance</em>, and then translate that into practical guidance: should Q4 budgets lean more into awareness-driving media, or is it time to shift resources toward messaging and channels that close the gap between awareness and active consideration?
