# Title
Lifecycle Push Raw Upload Pilot

# Description
Customer lifecycle marketing tested a mid-journey push notification. Every loyalty member in the pilot received the legacy control message on Monday and a journey-personalized notification on Wednesday. Marketers flagged whether each touch triggered an engaged response (tap-through plus site visit) or no response.

To mirror real workflow, this scenario feeds the app with the raw paired dataset of 90 members. Each row lists a member’s response to the control message and the personalized follow-up so the tool must aggregate the discordant wins before running McNemar’s test.
