# Title
B2B Nurture Content Tracks

# Description
A SaaS demand team is resurrecting a pool of dormant enterprise leads. They split every contact into two storytelling arcs that run for six weeks. The Tutorial Deep Dive series drip-feeds hands-on walkthroughs, while the Executive ROI track delivers board-level business cases to economic buyers.

Each contacted lead is recorded twice (before/after the creative change) so marketing can inspect whether one storyline tends to move a fence sitter into qualified pipeline. Load this preset to see how many discordant wins each track creates before budgeting the next sprint.
