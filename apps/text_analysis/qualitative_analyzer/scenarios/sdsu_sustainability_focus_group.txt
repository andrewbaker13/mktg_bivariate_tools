SDSU Students — Sustainability & Overconsumption of Reusable Products
Setting: SDSU research lab, 5:35 PM.
Recorder ON.

[INTRODUCTION]

MOD: Alright everyone, thanks for coming today. I know it’s a weekday evening and you could be doing… literally anything else, so I appreciate it. My name is Alex, and I’ll be your moderator. I’m not a professor here, I’m not grading you, I’m just here to guide the discussion.

Tonight, we’re talking about sustainability-related products — reusable water bottles, tote bags, thrifted clothing, “clean” beauty, all that stuff — and specifically how SDSU students engage with them. Including the ways students might actually over-consume reusable items.

You can swear, you can be blunt, you can disagree with each other — just don’t attack anyone personally. Cool?

Lena: (laughs) Love that rule.

Chris: Yeah, sounds good.

MOD: Awesome. Let’s do quick intros. First name, year, major, and one reused or “eco-ish” item you use all the time.

[INTRODUCTIONS]

Maya: I’m Maya, junior, Environmental Studies. I basically live with my Hydro Flask. And I have waaaay too many tote bags. Like… it’s embarrassing.

Chris: I’m Chris, senior in Business. I’ve got one reusable bottle from Aztec Market. It was like $8. That’s my guy.

Lena: I’m Lena, Comm major, sophomore. And yeah, I’m one of those girls with a Stanley that’s like a third the size of my torso. It is what it is.

Jordan: I’m Jordan, psych senior. I use one Nalgene and that’s all I need. If it breaks I’ll get another. Until then, no more stuff.

Rico: I’m Rico, sophomore, CS. I use a metal insulated bottle I bought after watching like… twenty YouTube reviews. That’s my process for everything.

Sarah: I’m Sarah, first-year. I have a Trader Joe’s tote for literally everything. And a small reusable bottle someone gifted me.

MOD: Awesome, thanks everyone.

WARM-UP (Minutes 3–8)

MOD: When you picture “sustainable products” used by SDSU students, what comes to mind first?

Lena: Water bottles, obviously. It’s like a fashion category at this point.

Jordan: Yeah. Water bottles, tote bags, thrifted clothes. Some people thrift like it’s the Olympics.

Chris: (laughing) Facts. People show up to class with like two bags and three bottles. Like… why?

Maya: Hey! Some people like to be prepared.

Chris: Prepared for what, a desert expedition?

(group laughs)

Rico: For me, it’s metal straws. Every girl in my dorm last year had a metal straw phase. Then never used them again.

Sarah: My roommates have those too. They came in little velvet bags.

Lena: Oh yeah, the velvet “straw sleeve.” I had one. Lost it in like two days.

MOD: Where do you see these items the most on campus?

Maya: ARC. For sure.

Jordan: ARC, Trader Joe’s, the walkways, the dorm lobbies.

Chris: I swear the water bottle is like an SDSU uniform piece.

Lena: Yeah, like if you don’t have one, people look at you like… “Are you okay?”

(group laughs)

MOD: Does SDSU feel like a sustainability-minded campus?

Jordan: Kind of. Like… the vibes are there. The behaviors aren’t always.

Maya: I think we try more than a lot of places.

Chris: But we also produce so much trash at the dining halls. So… mixed.

Rico: It’s sustainability-aware, not sustainability-consistent.

MOD: That’s a great phrase.

FOCUS GROUP TRANSCRIPT — PART 2 (~Minutes 8–15)

Conversation becomes more natural, with drift, interruption, and story-sharing.

Recorder still ON.

[MAIN DISCUSSION – PERSONAL HABITS]

MOD: Let’s dig into personal habits.
What reusable or “eco” items do you actually use regularly — and how many of each do you own?

Lena: Okay, in full honesty? I have… maybe eight water bottles.

Chris: Eight?! Why?!

Lena: Because they’re cute! And I forget them! And my roommate steals mine sometimes! And then sometimes I just want a different vibe!

Jordan: That sounds like chaos.

Lena: It is chaos.
But also — I use like… three of them consistently.

Maya: I have six. I know that’s a lot, but I use most of them. I rotate.

Chris: “Rotate” is such a funny word for bottles.

Maya: It’s like… different bottles for different contexts.

Chris: What contexts require different bottles??

Maya: Gym bottle. Class bottle. Hiking bottle. At-home bottle.

Jordan: This sounds like the opposite of sustainable.

(group laughter)

Rico enters the conversation

Rico: I only buy a new bottle if it’s actually better designed. Like if it keeps water cold longer, or the lid’s easier to clean. That’s it.

Lena: You’re like… function over fashion.

Rico: I mean… yeah. It’s a container for water.

Lena: No, it’s a statement.

Chris: It shouldn’t be a statement.

Maya: It IS, though. At SDSU at least.

Sarah speaks up

Sarah: I have three bottles. The one I actually use is tiny though. I take it to class. The other two are just… in my closet. I think I brought them from home?

Jordan: And why don’t you use them?

Sarah: I forget about them. And the small one fits in my backpack pocket.

Chris: Backpack pocket size matters. I’ll give you that.

TOTES DISCUSSION BEGINS

MOD: What about tote bags? How many do you all own?

Lena: Oh God. Um…
Eight? Maybe ten? One says “Be kind to the planet,” which is very ironic now that I’m saying it out loud.

(group laughs)

Maya: Twelve.

Chris: Okay that’s actually nuts.

Maya: I LIKE THEM. They’re cute, okay? And they’re free at events. And they fold small.
And sometimes I buy them because they have cool designs.

Jordan: I have… one. You only need one.

Lena: That’s so minimalist it stresses me out.

Jordan: Your number stresses me out.

MODERATOR STEERING

MOD: Why do SDSU students buy so many reusable items?

Lena: TikTok.

Chris: 100%.

Lena: Like you see “What’s in my bag?” videos and think, “Ooh I want that bottle.”
Or the ones where people line up all their Stanleys in pastel colors? That… does something to my brain.

Jordan: It’s digital peer pressure.

Rico: There’s also a moral reinforcement element. Like “If it’s sustainable, it’s fine to buy it.”

Maya: But it’s not.
Sustainable things are only sustainable if you replace single-use items with them — and keep them for a long time.

Chris: Thank you.

PERSONAL STORY — A NATURAL DRIFT

MOD: Has anyone ever bought a reusable item you immediately regretted?

Sarah: Oh my God, yes. I bought one of those collapsible silicone cups. And it leaked everywhere. Like, it folded on itself in my backpack and coffee just—
(hand motion)
—everywhere. My laptop sleeve was soaked.

Rico: Silicone cups are scams.

Jordan: They smell weird too.

Lena: Oh my god YES, they smell like… like silicone Barbie plastic.

(group laughs)

Maya: I bought beeswax wraps once. I used them maybe twice. They got sticky and weird.

Chris: Beeswax wraps are adult Pinterest energy.

Maya: Hey!
(laughing)
It was a phase.

STORY: LENA’S ROOMMATE & WATER BOTTLES

Lena: My roommate freshman year bought like… a new water bottle every month. It was like she was collecting them. And then we ended up with a cabinet full of bottles that didn’t match anything.

Chris: A cabinet?

Lena: A whole-ass cabinet!
And then when she moved out she left half of them. So I inherited random bottles.

Jordan: That’s how clutter wins. It creeps up.

MODERATOR CHECK-IN

MOD: So would you say sustainability often becomes… overconsumption dressed up as good intentions?

Jordan: Absolutely.

Rico: 100%.

Sarah: Yeah, but I don’t think people mean to do it.

Maya: No one means to.
But you can’t just buy every “eco” product you see and call it sustainable.

SEGUE INTO MORE DEPTH

MOD: Good — that leads nicely into the next section.
But before we go there, let’s pause:

Anything surprising you’re noticing about what others have said so far?

Chris: I’m surprised how many bottles y’all have.

Lena: I’m surprised you can live with ONE.

Jordan: I’m surprised none of you have bottle anxiety.

MOD: Bottle anxiety?

Jordan: The fear of being judged for your water bottle choice.

(group bursts out laughing)

Lena: That’s REAL though!

Sarah: No it’s not!

Lena: YES IT IS. People judge bottles.

Maya: Hydro Flask people and Stanley people have beef.

Rico: Nalgene is the Switzerland of water bottles.

Chris: Nah, Nalgene is like the granola outdoors kid who sleeps in a hammock for fun.

[DEEPER IDENTITY DISCUSSION]

MOD: Let’s talk more explicitly about identity.
Do reusable items signal a certain type of student at SDSU?

Chris: Oh totally.

Lena: For sure.

Maya: Yes, definitely.

Jordan: Yeah, 100%.

MOD: Okay — then let’s break that down.
Describe the “SDSU Hydro Flask person.”

Lena: VSCO girl vibes. I know that's old now, but it still lingers. Cute outfits, scrunchies, iced coffee.

Sarah: She listens to Olivia Rodrigo while walking to class.

Maya: She buys at least one thing from Urban Outfitters a week.

Jordan: She 100% has a planner covered in stickers about mental health and astrology.

(group laughs)

Chris: That’s dead-on.

MOD: How about a “Stanley person”?

Lena: (points at herself) Me.
Guilty. But I stand by it.

Chris: They’re more… influencer-coded.

Jordan: They are the sorority pipeline.

Lena: HEY.
Okay maybe.

(laughter)

Maya: Stanley people care a LOT about aesthetics.

Rico: I think Stanley people are chasing a feeling of “I have my life together.”

Sarah: And half the time they don’t.

(group cracks up)

MOD: And the “Nalgene person”?

Jordan: My people.

Maya: Outdoorsy. Practical. Might have a carabiner on their backpack.

Chris: The “I hike Cowles Mountain at sunrise” crowd.

Rico: They wear socks with sandals.

(laughter)

Sarah: They probably compost.

Jordan: I DO compost!

(more laughter)

[THE MOOD SHIFTS – PARTICIPANTS GET MORE CANDID]

MOD: Do you ever judge someone by their reusable items?

Chris: Absolutely. Bottle choice says a LOT.

Sarah: Yeah but it’s not like… a bad judgment. It’s more like decoding their major.

Maya: YES. Water bottles tell you people’s majors.

Lena: Psych people carry Nalgenes.

Jordan: Facts.

Lena: Business bros carry shaker bottles.

Chris: Hey—
(laughs)
We do not all carry shakers.

Rico: Computer science majors have generic Amazon thermoses.

Sarah: Environmental Studies majors have the cutest bottles, actually.

Maya: THANK you.

[MODERATOR STEERING TOWARD ACTIVITY]

MOD: You’re all describing these objects as if they were personalities…
Perfect, because that’s exactly what we’re about to do next.

We’re going to do a projective exercise — a classic technique in qualitative research.

This is Activity 1.

ACTIVITY 1 — PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUE (~Minutes 18–25)
“If this reusable item were a person…”

MOD: I’ll name an item. You tell me what this item would be like as a person at SDSU — personality, style, habits, everything.

No wrong answers. Be imaginative.
Ready?

Group: (murmurs) Yeah / sure / okay.

ITEM 1: “The SDSU Reusable Water Bottle” as a Person

MOD: Start simple. The average SDSU reusable water bottle.
If it were a person, describe them.

Lena: They are chronically late.

Chris: And always carrying too much stuff.

Jordan: They’re bubbly but stressed.

Maya: They care about wellness — like probiotics, yoga, doing their “hot girl walk.”

Rico: They absolutely overuse the word “literally.”

(everyone bursts out laughing)

Sarah: They always have lip gloss. Always.

Jordan: And headphones around their neck.

Lena: No, AirPods. Always.

ITEM 2: “The SDSU Canvas Tote Bag” as a Person

MOD: Next item: the typical SDSU tote bag.

Jordan: She’s that girl who pretends she’s low-maintenance but actually overthinks everything.

Lena: She’s a Trader Joe’s regular.

Chris: Reads Colleen Hoover between classes.

Rico: Listens to indie-pop playlists titled things like “dreamy mornings.”

Maya: She’s artistic. Maybe a graphic design major.

Sarah: And she always has snacks in the tote. Like, trail mix or something healthy-ish.

(group nods)

ITEM 3: “The SDSU Thrifted Sweatshirt” as a Person

MOD: Now: imagine a thrifted SDSU crewneck as a person.

Rico: They think they’re more unique than they are.

Chris: They brag about thrifting like it’s a personality.

Lena: Okay but also — they’re cool. Kind of effortlessly cool.

Jordan: They wear Doc Martens year-round.

Maya: They read their horoscope every morning.

Sarah: They have a Hydro Flask covered in stickers that say things like “Save the bees.”

(group laughs)

MODERATOR DEBRIEF

MOD: What do these “people” reveal about how SDSU students see sustainability items?

Jordan: They’re identity props. Like little personality signifiers.

Lena: They’re social categories.

Chris: They show who we want to be — OR who we think we want to be.

Maya: Sometimes they’re aspirational. Like… the bottle version of “I have my life together.”

Rico: Or they’re like a shortcut to fitting in.

Sarah: And honestly — they’re kinda fun.

MOD: Great insights.

[POST-ACTIVITY CHURN: STUDENTS REFLECT + NATURAL DRIFT]

MOD: Great. We’ll shift gears soon, but before we do — does anything about that exercise feel accurate to your experience on campus?

Jordan: Yeah, it showed how predictable we are. Like, we basically described half the people I pass walking to class.

Lena: Actually though — SDSU is sooo bottle-coded. Like every water bottle is a personality.

Chris: It’s crazy that we can all agree on the stereotypes that fast.

Sarah: I think it’s because trends are really strong here. Like everyone’s trying to fit in.

Maya: Or everyone’s trying to look like they have their life together. Especially girls. There’s so much performative wellness.

Lena: Guilty.
(laughs)
But also, it’s fun. Like it’s fun having cute stuff.

CONFLICT LIGHTS UP — A NATURAL MOMENT OF TENSION

Chris: But then is it actually sustainable? Like buying eight different bottles because they’re “cute” — come on.

Lena: Okay, first of all — I didn’t buy eight. Half were gifts.

Chris: Still eight though.

Lena: Why do you care?
(laughs but defensive)
If I actually use them, what’s the problem?

Jordan: But you don’t use them all.

Lena: I use… some.

Maya: I think the problem is the mindset — like sustainable stuff becomes an excuse to over-shop.

Lena: Okay but literally everything is over-shopped. Why are reusable bottles the hill to die on?

Chris: Because they’re marketed as eco-friendly.

Rico: Yeah — buying more “eco-friendly” things kind of defeats the point.

Lena: Fine, fine. But you’re acting like I’m single-handedly killing the planet.

Maya: (snorts) No one said that.

Sarah: Guys, Lena’s bottles aren’t ending the world.
(group laughs)

MODERATOR REFOCUS

MOD: Alright — I’m loving the honesty.
Let’s widen this back out.

Do you think that overconsumption disguised as sustainability is a common SDSU thing?

Jordan: Oh for sure.

Chris: More common than people admit.

Maya: It’s everywhere. Especially with clothes.

Lena: Thrifting is like… a full-time sport on this campus. And sometimes people use “it’s thrifted” to justify buying tons of stuff.

Rico: And the thrift stores near campus get picked over because everyone is doing it.

Sarah: My roommate goes thrifting weekly. Like more than grocery shopping.

Jordan: That’s wild.

REAL STORY: ROOMMATE CHAOS (MINI-TANGENT)

Lena: My roommate last year had fifteen tote bags hung on a single command hook. It looked like a sad curtain made of bags.

(group cracks up)

Chris: That’s amazing.

Lena: And she kept buying more because she’d forget one and be like “Oh well, they’re sustainable!” And I’d be like “BRO, that’s not how that works.”

Maya: Tote hoarding is real.

Sarah: I have a basket full of totes. I don’t even know how it happened.

Jordan: Twenty percent of sustainability is vibes, eighty percent is clutter.

(laughter)

A SMALL ARGUMENT ABOUT CONVENIENCE VS. EFFORT

MOD: What stops you from being more sustainable?

Chris: Convenience. That’s it. If reusables were easier, I’d use them more.

Maya: But how much easier do you want them to be? You literally just fill the bottle.

Chris: Well yeah — but if I forget it or it’s dirty, I’m not gonna like… strategize. I’ll just buy a drink.

Lena: Same. Sorry but like, if I’m running late? I’m not washing a cup.

Rico: Behaviorally, people default to convenience. We’re not robots.

Jordan: Sustainability requires planning. Students don’t plan.

Sarah: Yeah… we really don’t.

(general laughter)

A FEW STORY MOMENTS THAT FILL THE “REAL TIME” FEEL

MOD: Have you ever felt judged for NOT being sustainable?

Sarah: Yeah, I bought a bottled lemonade in class and the girl next to me looked at me like I had kicked her cat.

Lena: OH MY GOD same. I ordered DoorDash and the guy next to me was like “That’s so much waste.” I was hungry, dude.

Jordan: People love judging but don’t look at their own stuff.

Maya: I judge silently.

(group cracks up)

Chris: Yeah, Maya’s the silent judge.

Maya: I’m TRYING to be less judgmental! But yes… it happens.

MODERATOR SETS UP THE TRANSITION TO ACTIVITY 2

MOD: These are amazing stories.
Before we lose track of time, let’s move to our second exercise.

This one’s more tactile.
I’ve got a bag full of real sustainability items.

Jordan: Oooooh props.

Lena: Oh boy.

Rico: This is gonna be interesting.

MOD:
Right — this is called a stimulus-based elicitation activity.
I’ll hand each of you an item from the bag.
When you get yours, react however feels natural — stereotypes, usefulness, emotions, who you think buys it, whatever.

Everybody ready?

Group: Yeah / let’s go / bring it.

[ACTIVITY 2 – BRING-IT-OUT BAG BEGINS]

Moderator drops a canvas bag on the center of the table. The soft thunk of multiple objects shifting inside draws reactions.

Lena: That bag is like… giving Mary Poppins energy.

Chris: There’s definitely a Stanley in there.

MOD:
You’ll see.
I’ll hand each of you one item. Don’t overthink it — just say the first things that come to mind.

(MOD starts distributing items around the table.)

ITEM 1: Stanley Cup — Lena’s Reaction

MOD: Lena, looks like you got the Stanley cup.

Lena: (holding it with reverence)
YES.
My people.

Chris: Of course YOU got that one.

Lena: Okay — first reaction?
This is the “I have my shit together” cup. Catch me speed-walking down Campanile Walkway with this and an iced coffee I don’t need.

Jordan: That’s not sustainable, that’s a personality trait.

Lena: Exactly.
And here’s the thing — people LIKE that it’s a personality trait. It’s like being part of a club.

Rico: Except the club costs like $50 to join.

Lena: Okay, yeah, they’re overpriced. I know. BUT THEY’RE CUTE.

Chris: Cute capitalism.

(group laughs)

ITEM 2: Hydro Flask — Maya’s Reaction

MOD: Maya, you’ve got the Hydro Flask.

Maya: This is the OG.
This bottle ran so the Stanley could sprint.

Sarah: (laughs) Accurate.

Maya: Hydro Flask energy is “I care about the planet and also went through a VSCO phase in 2019.”

Jordan: They do dent like CRAZY.

Rico: Hydro Flasks are indestructible except emotionally.

(laughter)

Maya: I still love mine. It’s my emotional support bottle.

Chris: You guys have emotional support OBJECTS?

Lena: Chris… sweetie… everyone does.

ITEM 3: Metal Straw Kit — Rico’s Reaction

MOD: Rico, you’re holding the metal straws.

Rico: Metal straws are like…
The “I’m trying but barely” starter pack.

Sarah: They’re so annoying to keep track of though.

Jordan: And cleaning them? No thank you.

Rico: Data-wise — metal straws only become eco-beneficial after like 120 to 150 uses. Most people use them maybe ten times.

Maya: PREACH.

Lena: They’re aesthetic though.
Until you stab yourself with one in the car.

(group erupts laughing)

Chris: That happened to you?

Lena: I don’t want to talk about it.

ITEM 4: Trader Joe’s Cotton Tote — Sarah’s Reaction

MOD: Sarah, you’ve got the Trader Joe’s tote.

Sarah: Ugh, my weakness.
I buy one every time. They get me.

Jordan: For what reason??

Sarah: They’re 99 cents! It feels illegal NOT to buy them.

Maya: But they take hundreds of uses to offset a plastic bag…

Chris: No one uses a tote 200 times. They use it 20 times then forget it in the trunk and buy a new one.

Sarah: Hello yes that is me, I am the problem.

(group cracks up)

ITEM 5: Thrifted Sweatshirt — Jordan’s Reaction

MOD: Jordan, you’ve got the thrifted sweatshirt.

Jordan: This is peak SDSU core.
Half the campus has a vintage Aztecs crewneck.

Lena: And it always looks effortlessly cute on other people.

Jordan: But thrifting is getting… aggressive.
Like, some people thrift HAULS. That’s just consuming but with extra steps.

Rico: Thrift store inflation is real too — they mark things up when thrifting becomes trendy.

Maya: It’s like “sustainable shopping” turned into a sport.

Chris: Yeah and some people treat it like they’re saving the earth one crewneck at a time.

ITEM 6: “Eco-Friendly” Skincare Bottle — Lena interrupts before assignment

MOD: Okay, next up—
Oh wait, this one actually goes to—

Lena: PLEASE give me the skincare. I need to drag myself.

(laughing around the table)

MOD: Go for it.

Lena: This is my problem category.
Every time I see packaging that’s “matte green with a leaf” I’m like Ohhhh sustainable queen! Add to cart!

Chris: That’s marketing brainwashing.

Lena: I KNOW! But it works!

Rico: Most “clean beauty” sustainability claims are meaningless. It’s all vibes.

Maya: Vibes are powerful.

Jordan: Too powerful.

ITEM 7: Beeswax Wrap — Chris’s Reaction

MOD: Chris, you’ve got the beeswax wrap.

Chris: This… is nonsense.

(group bursts out laughing)

Jordan: Valid.

Chris: Like — you want me to wrap food in sticky cloth? No. Absolutely not.

Sarah: My mom uses these.

Chris: Moms love them. College students? No way.

Maya: I TRIED.
It got gross so fast. And then I felt guilty throwing it away.

Rico: That’s the beeswax curse.

Lena: “Beeswax curse”… I’m dead.

ITEM 8: Collapsible Silicone Cup — Jordan jumps in with a story

MOD: And last — the collapsible silicone cup.

Jordan: Oh my god, these things.
They fold in on themselves and spill EVERYWHERE.

Sarah: Mine did that too!

Chris: They smell weird.

Lena: Like Barbie feet.

(group absolutely loses it)

MOD: Okay okay — staying focused.
What’s the overall feeling these items bring up?

Jordan: Overhyped nonsense.

Maya: Mixed intentions. Good ideas executed badly.

Chris: Guilt shopping.

Lena: Aesthetic addiction.

Rico: Misinformation.

Sarah: They’re cute though… I like cute things.

MODERATOR WRAP-UP OF ACTIVITY

MOD:
Awesome. This was hilarious and actually very insightful.
We’ve got one last segment before we wrap — and it’s where we get into the contradictions, guilt, and what SDSU could do better.

Let’s take a breath and keep going.

(everyone settles)

[THE CONTRADICTIONS SECTION]

MOD: Alright, last big topic before we wrap.
We’ve talked about all these products…
But now I want to ask the real question:

Do you feel students at SDSU say they care about sustainability more than they actually act like it?

Jordan: Yes. Absolutely yes.

Chris: Not even close. Talking and doing are two completely different sports.

Lena: I mean, yeah… but it’s not like people are trying to be fake. It’s just… life gets in the way.

Maya: There’s definitely performative sustainability on campus.
Like people post about thrifting and climate marches — and then do a Shein haul the next week.

Lena: Okay but Shein is cheap.

Maya: Cheap is not the same as ethical.

Lena: I KNOW. I KNOW.
I’m not proud of it.

Sarah: I’ve bought from Shein too.
Mostly for Halloween costumes though — can we get a pass on that?

Jordan: Halloween gets a pass.
But like… weekly microtrend tops? That’s on you.

(laughter)

[GUILT — A NATURAL MOMENT]

MOD:
Do you ever feel guilty when you’re not sustainable?

Chris: Occasionally. Like when I toss a plastic bottle and the recycling bin is 10 feet away and I miss and don’t go pick it up. I’m a bad person in that moment.

(group laughs)

Lena: I feel guilty when I forget my tote at Trader Joe’s and I’m like, “Ugh, I’m paying 10 cents to destroy the planet.”

Jordan: I feel guilty when I buy something I don’t need and it just adds to my already cursed closet.

Sarah: I feel guilty when I buy bottled drinks.
People in class judge you with their eyes.

Rico: I don’t do guilt.
I do… “not this again.”
Like when I buy a new “eco-product” and realize later it was a lie.

Maya: I feel guilt when I WANT to be better but I slip.
Like I can’t yell at the whole world to care if I’m slipping too.

[STUDENT RECOGNITION OF REAL LIMITATIONS]

MOD:
What makes it hard to be consistent?

Jordan: College is chaotic.

Lena: Yeah. The idea of like… perfectly sustainable habits is unrealistic.

Chris: Half the time you’re just trying not to fail your midterms. Sustainability is like thought #47.

(everyone nods)

Sarah: Also space. Dorms are tiny. You can’t have giant jars of bulk soaps and a compost bucket.
Like where would that even go?

Rico: And misinformation. There’s so much contradictory info online.

Maya: THAT PART.
Everyone thinks they know the right facts, but every TikTok says something different.

[WHAT SDSU COULD DO BETTER]

MOD:
Okay — rapid-fire:
What could SDSU do to make sustainability easier for students?

Jordan: More refill water stations.
Especially outdoors.

Lena: Reusable starter kits for freshmen. One bottle, one tote, one set of utensils.

Chris: Better recycling bins.
Half the time I’m like “Does this go here? Who knows.”

Sarah: More secondhand clothing pop-ups. The ones they do are always packed.

Maya: Offer bulk refills for soaps, cleaning supplies, laundry detergent.
That would be huge.

Rico: And a simple chart that shows the REAL environmental impact of items.
Like “Cotton totes must be used X times.”
Just… honest info.

MOD: Love those. Super practical.

[CLOSING REFLECTION – ONE SENTENCE ADVICE]

MOD:
Last question — what’s one piece of sustainability advice you’d give to an incoming SDSU first-year?

Jordan: Use what you already have. Don’t buy 50 new things for college.

Lena: Buy ONE GOOD bottle and stick with it.

Chris: Don’t let guilt drive your shopping. Buy what you’ll actually use.

Maya: Learn the difference between real sustainability and greenwashing.

Rico: Research before you buy. Even two minutes helps.

Sarah: Don’t copy your roommates’ shopping habits. They’re not always smart.

(group laughs)

[MODERATOR FINAL WRAP-UP]

MOD:
This was fantastic. Seriously — you’ve been honest, funny, thoughtful, and super insightful.
Thank you so much for participating.

Before you go, check out with me outside for your incentive.
And please grab snacks. They’re disappearing either way.

Lena: I’m taking like three. Sustainability, baby.

(group laughs and starts gathering their things)

MOD:
Alright, we’re off.
Thanks again, everyone.

(Recorder clicks off.)
