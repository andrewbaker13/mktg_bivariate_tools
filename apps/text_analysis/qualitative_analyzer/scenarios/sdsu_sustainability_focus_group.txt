[DEEPER IDENTITY DISCUSSION]

MOD: So, before we dive into the actual items, I'm curious — who here actually uses sustainability stuff regularly?

Chris: I have a reusable water bottle and a couple tote bags.

Lena: Same. But honestly, I only use them when I remember. (laughs)

Maya: I feel like I buy stuff with good intentions, and then… it just sits in my room.

Jordan: Yeah, it's more aspirational than practical. Like, I want to be the person who's always prepared.

Rico: (points at himself) I'm the guy who buys a metal straw and then loses it a week later.

(group laughs)

Sarah: It's also about habit, though. Like, I didn't bring reusable bags everywhere until stores started charging for plastic.

Lena: Right, it's the external push. If there's no consequence, I forget.

Jordan: Or if the process is inconvenient. Like, I'm not carrying a Tupperware container around campus all day.

MOD: So sustainability becomes more about habit and convenience than pure intention?

Chris: Totally. I think if it's easy and normalized, I'll do it. But if I have to go out of my way, I'm way less likely.

Maya: And there's also the social element. If everyone's bringing reusable bags to the farmers' market, you feel like you should too. But on campus? Not so much.

Jordan: That's interesting because SDSU does market itself as a sustainability-focused campus. But do we actually see that reflected in student culture?

Sarah: Not really. I mean, the solar panels and recycling bins are there, but it doesn't feel like a movement.

Rico: It's performative. Like, the school checks the boxes, but no one's actually making it a lifestyle.

[THE MOOD SHIFTS – PARTICIPANTS GET MORE CANDID]

Lena: Okay, real talk though — I also don't know if it actually matters. Like, is my reusable water bottle really making a dent?

Chris: Right, like corporations are doing way more damage. Why is the burden on us?

Maya: I've thought about that too. Like, should I feel guilty for using a plastic fork, or should I be mad at the system?

MOD: So there's tension between individual responsibility and systemic change.

Jordan: Exactly. And companies use that against us. They make us feel bad for our choices so we don't hold them accountable.

Sarah: But at the same time, I do think small choices add up. Like, if a million students stopped using disposable stuff, that's not nothing.

Rico: True, but the question is whether we actually care enough to do it consistently. And I think for most of us, the answer is no.

(awkward laughter)

ACTIVITY 1 — PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUE (~Minutes 18–25)

MOD: Alright, let's shift gears. I'm going to show you some SDSU-branded sustainability items, and I want you to describe what kind of person you imagine using them. Not yourself — someone else.

ITEM 1: "The SDSU Reusable Water Bottle"

Lena: That's the girl who brings her laptop to outdoor study spots and drinks oat milk lattes.

Maya: (laughs) She definitely has a Hydro Flask sticker collection.

Jordan: She's in an environmental science major, probably part of a sustainability club.

Chris: She posts her reusable bottle on her Instagram story with the caption, "Saving the planet one sip at a time."

Rico: She judges people for buying plastic water bottles. (group laughs)

Sarah: Okay, but is that bad? Like, she's at least doing something.

Jordan: True, but there's a performative aspect to it. Like, is it about the environment, or is it about the aesthetic?

ITEM 2: "SDSU Tote Bag"

Maya: This is the girl who's always carrying way too much stuff and has a water bottle hanging off one side.

Lena: She uses it for groceries, but also for transporting books, snacks, a full meal prep…

Sarah: She's the type who says, "I refuse to pay for bags," even though it's 10 cents.

Chris: (laughs) She's the one who brings it to Target and then ends up buying way more than she planned because she "has room."

Jordan: I feel like this is also the person who has, like, five tote bags but only uses one.

Rico: So basically all of us. (everyone laughs)

ITEM 3: "The Metal Straw Set"

Lena: That's for the person who has their life together. Like, they actually remember to bring it to coffee shops.

Chris: She's also the one who will lecture you if you use a plastic straw.

Maya: But in a nice way. Like, "Oh, you know plastic straws are bad, right?"

Jordan: And she probably keeps it in a cute little pouch.

Sarah: She's the type who makes TikToks about sustainable living.

Rico: Wait, do people actually use these? I've never seen someone pull out a metal straw in public.

Sarah: I have! But it's rare. Mostly at, like, trendy cafes.

[POST-ACTIVITY CHURN: STUDENTS REFLECT + NATURAL DRIFT]

MOD: So, what did you notice about the "person" you all imagined?

Jordan: It's always a girl. Like, no one imagined a guy using these.

Lena: Oh my god, you're right. (laughs)

Chris: I mean, guys do use reusable water bottles, but the other stuff? Not as much.

Rico: Yeah, I feel like sustainability is kind of… feminized?

Maya: That's interesting because environmental activism is pretty gender-neutral, but the products definitely aren't marketed that way.

Sarah: Or maybe it's just that women are more likely to care about aesthetics, so the products are designed for them.

Jordan: But that reinforces the idea that sustainability is performative. Like, it's not about function; it's about how it looks.

MOD: Do you think that impacts whether people use these items?

Chris: For sure. If I see something that looks too "influencer-y," I'm not gonna want it.

Lena: Same. Like, if it's too trendy, it feels like it's gonna go out of style.

Maya: But at the same time, if something's not cute, I'm not gonna carry it around. (laughs)

Rico: So we're stuck. It has to look good, but not too good. (everyone laughs)

ACTIVITY 2 — ITEM PERSONALIZATION (~Minutes 25–33)

MOD: Now, I'm going to ask you to imagine these items were customized specifically for you. What would make you actually want to use them?

ITEM 1: "SDSU Water Bottle"

Jordan: If it had a design that actually represented SDSU culture, not just the logo. Like, something about the beaches or the vibe here.

Lena: I'd want something minimalist. Not too loud.

Chris: I'd want something that's, like, limited edition. If everyone has the same one, it loses appeal.

Maya: Or if it were designed by students. Like, a collaboration thing.

Sarah: I think it should be functional first. Like, if it keeps my water cold all day, I'll use it. I don't care what it looks like.

Rico: But realistically, if it's free and decent quality, I'm using it. I'm not that picky. (laughs)

ITEM 2: "Tote Bag"

Maya: I'd want it to be sturdy. Like, I've had so many cheap tote bags that rip.

Lena: And it should be a neutral color. If it's bright red or something, I'm not using it.

Jordan: I think it should be big enough for textbooks and a laptop, but not so big that it's awkward.

Chris: Or, like, have different sizes. A small one for quick trips, a big one for groceries.

Sarah: And pockets! Why do tote bags never have pockets?

Rico: Honestly, if it's free, I'll take it. But I probably won't use it unless I actually need it in that moment. (points at herself)

ITEM 3: "Metal Straw Set"

Lena: I'd never use this unless it came with a case that clips onto my backpack.

Jordan: Or if it collapsed so it's not awkwardly long.

Chris: I think this is just impractical for students. Like, who's gonna wash it between classes?

Maya: That's the thing — it requires too much effort. Unless it's dishwasher-safe and super convenient, no one's using it.

Sarah: I'd only use it if I were at home. Not on the go.

Rico: Yeah, this is the kind of thing you buy, feel good about for a day, and then forget. (group laughs but also nods in agreement)

[MODERATOR DEBRIEF]

MOD: Before we wrap up, what would actually make you care more about using sustainable products on campus?

Jordan: If SDSU made it easier. Like, more refill stations, incentives for bringing reusable stuff.

Lena: Or if it were, like, a social norm. If everyone did it, I'd be more likely to.

Chris: I think it has to be tied to something we already care about. Like, if using a reusable bottle saved me money on drinks, I'd do it.

Maya: Or if there were consequences for not using them. Like, a fee for disposable stuff.

Sarah: But that would be controversial. People would complain.

Rico: True, but maybe that's what it takes. Like, we're not gonna change unless we're forced to. (laughs but defensive)

Jordan: I think it's also about messaging. If SDSU framed it as part of our identity, like "this is what Aztecs do," maybe more people would buy in.

MOD: So it's less about the products themselves and more about the culture and systems around them?

Chris: Exactly. The products are fine. It's just… why should I care?

Lena: And that's the real question, honestly. If I don't see the impact, or if it's not convenient, I'm not gonna do it. (group murmurs in agreement)

MOD: Alright, thank you all for being so honest today. This was really insightful.
