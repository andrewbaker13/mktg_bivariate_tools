# Title
Ad Spend × Seasonality Interaction Effect on Revenue

# Description
<div class="scenario-description">
  <p>
    Your ecommerce brand runs paid digital campaigns year-round, but the marketing team has observed that <strong>the same dollar of ad spend seems to produce different revenue outcomes depending on the season</strong>. Specifically, holiday season campaigns appear to generate more revenue per ad dollar than off-season campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
    To investigate this statistically, you collected weekly data over two years tracking:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weekly Revenue</strong> (outcome, $)</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Ad Spend</strong> (continuous predictor, $)</li>
    <li><strong>Season</strong> (categorical predictor: Q1_Winter, Q2_Spring, Q3_Summer, Q4_Holiday)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The key question is whether there's an <strong>interaction effect</strong>: does the relationship between ad spend and revenue <em>differ</em> across seasons? In statistical terms, does the slope of ad spend vary by season?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you'll learn:</strong> This scenario demonstrates a <strong>continuous × categorical interaction</strong>. The interaction term allows the effect of ad spend on revenue to vary by season. If significant, it means one dollar of ad spend has a different marginal effect in Q4 (holidays) versus Q1 (winter lull). This insight can inform seasonal budget allocation strategies.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select interaction type:</strong> Choose "Continuous × Categorical interaction"</li>
  <li><strong>Assign variables:</strong> Focal = ad_spend, Moderator = season (or vice versa)</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret the plot:</strong> You'll see separate lines for each season showing how revenue responds to ad spend</li>
  <li><strong>Check the interaction coefficient:</strong> Tests whether slopes differ significantly across seasons</li>
  <li><strong>Business implication:</strong> If interaction is significant, allocate more budget to high-ROI seasons</li>
</ul>
