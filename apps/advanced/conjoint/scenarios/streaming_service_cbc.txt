This scenario presents a CBC study for subscription streaming services. The study includes 200 respondents completing 10 choice tasks each.

Context:
A media company is planning to launch a new streaming platform and wants to understand what features, content offerings, and price points will drive subscriptions in a competitive market.

Study Design:
- Respondents: 200 streaming service users (mixed current subscribers to various platforms)
- Tasks: Each respondent viewed 10 choice scenarios
- Alternatives per task: 3-4 service options + "None/Keep current service"
- Competitor services: Netflix and Disney+ appeared as fixed alternatives in some tasks

Attributes tested:
1. Content library size: Small (5K titles), Medium (15K titles), Large (30K titles)
2. Original content: None, Moderate (5 originals/month), Extensive (15 originals/month)
3. Ad-free experience: With ads, Ad-free
4. Simultaneous streams: 1 device, 2 devices, 4 devices
5. Video quality: HD, 4K Ultra HD
6. Monthly price: $5.99, $9.99, $14.99, $19.99

Special features:
- "None" means the respondent would not subscribe (keeping their current service or going without)
- Competitor platforms (Netflix, Disney+) serve as benchmarks

Research questions:
- What drives streaming service choice: content quantity, quality, or price?
- How much are customers willing to pay for ad-free experience?
- Can a new entrant compete on value or must they focus on exclusive originals?
- Which customer segments prioritize different bundles (e.g., families needing 4 streams vs. individuals)?
- What pricing tier maximizes revenue vs. subscriber count?

Use cases:
✓ Launch strategy: Choose optimal feature bundle for market entry
✓ Pricing optimization: Find profit-maximizing price point
✓ Competitive positioning: Understand where new service can differentiate
✓ Segmentation: Identify distinct customer groups (binge-watchers, casual viewers, families)
✓ Feature prioritization: Invest in originals vs. library size vs. technical quality
