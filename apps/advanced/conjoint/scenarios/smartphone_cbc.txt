This scenario simulates a choice-based conjoint (CBC) study for smartphone purchase decisions. The study was designed for 150 respondents who each completed 12 choice tasks.

Context:
A smartphone manufacturer wants to understand which product attributes drive purchase intent. They're considering launching a new model and need data on customer preferences to optimize the design and pricing strategy.

Study Design:
- Respondents: 150 consumers recruited from a panel, representative of the target market (ages 18-55, smartphone owners)
- Tasks: Each respondent viewed 12 choice scenarios
- Alternatives per task: 3 smartphone options (labeled A, B, C) + "None" option
- Competitor products: Two leading competitor smartphones (iPhone, Samsung) appeared in some tasks alongside experimental alternatives

Attributes tested:
1. Brand: BrandX (new brand), BrandY (established mid-tier), BrandZ (budget)
2. Screen size: 5.5", 6.0", 6.5"
3. Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB
4. Battery life: 12 hours, 18 hours, 24 hours
5. Camera quality: Standard (12MP), Enhanced (24MP), Professional (48MP with AI)
6. Price: $499, $599, $699, $799, $899

Special features:
- The "None" alternative represents "I would not purchase any of these"
- Competitor alternatives (iPhone, Samsung) were fixed profiles shown in some tasks to anchor preferences

Research questions:
- Which attributes matter most to customers when choosing a smartphone?
- How price-sensitive are different customer segments?
- What's the willingness-to-pay for premium features like larger storage or better cameras?
- Can the new brand (BrandX) compete with established players?
- Should we launch a value-tier product or focus on premium features?

This dataset allows you to:
✓ Estimate individual-level part-worth utilities
✓ Segment customers based on preferences (e.g., feature-focused vs. price-sensitive)
✓ Simulate market share for different product configurations
✓ Optimize product design for maximum profit or market penetration
