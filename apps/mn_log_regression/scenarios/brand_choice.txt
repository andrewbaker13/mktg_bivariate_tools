# Title
Three-stage funnel stage (Awareness / Consideration / Purchase)

# Description
<p><strong>Scenario 1 &mdash; Three-stage brand funnel.</strong> A mid-size consumer brand wants to understand how
its marketing touchpoints move people through the classic purchase funnel: <em>Awareness</em>,
<em>Consideration</em>, and <em>Purchase</em>. The dataset contains a few hundred survey respondents, each coded
for which funnel stage they are currently in, the primary channel where they recall seeing the brand (Email,
Social, or Search), how frequently they have been contacted (Low / Medium / High), and their age band.</p>
<p>The outcome variable <code>stage</code> is treated as a multinomial outcome with three categories.
<code>channel</code>, <code>frequency_segment</code>, and <code>age_band</code> are predictors. In a realistic
way, heavier contact and certain channels (for example, Search or targeted Email) tend to be more common among
Consideration and Purchase-stage customers, while lighter contact and Social impressions skew toward Awareness.
However, the data also include noise, so you should not expect perfectly clean separation.</p>
<p>Use this case to practice interpreting how each predictor shifts the <em>probability</em> of being in each
stage relative to a chosen reference outcome. For example, you might compare how the odds of being in
Consideration vs Awareness change as you move from low-frequency to high-frequency contact, holding age and
channel constant.</p>
<p>From a managerial perspective, this scenario mirrors a common marketing question: which levers most reliably
move customers deeper into the funnel? Try simulating the impact of shifting contacts from Social-only to
multi-channel, or increasing contact frequency for specific age bands, and observe how the predicted
distribution of funnel stages changes.</p>

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select the scenario:</strong> Choose the three-stage funnel case from the scenario menu to auto-load the
  sample dataset and description.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose an outcome:</strong> Use <code>stage</code> as the multinomial outcome (Awareness, Consideration,
  Purchase).</li>
  <li><strong>Pick predictors:</strong> Include <code>channel</code>, <code>frequency_segment</code>, and
  <code>age_band</code> as predictors. Experiment with different choices of reference outcome to see how the
  coefficient table and odds ratios change.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret effects:</strong> Use the coefficient table and predicted probability plots to tell a
  story about which channels and frequency levels are most strongly associated with moving customers from
  Awareness into deeper funnel stages.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect to decisions:</strong> Translate model findings into marketing actions, such as which
  segments to target with higher-frequency campaigns or which channels to emphasize for purchase-stage
  customers.</li>
</ul>
