<h3>Esports Engagement Segments (Multinomial Outcome)</h3>

<p>
This scenario models how different predictors relate to a three-level engagement segment for an esports title:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Casual</strong>: plays occasionally, low spend.</li>
  <li><strong>Core</strong>: plays regularly with moderate spend.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitive</strong>: heavy play and spend, often in ranked modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each row in the dataset represents a single player with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>player_id</code>: anonymized player identifier.</li>
  <li><code>engagement_segment</code>: multinomial outcome with three levels (Casual / Core / Competitive).</li>
  <li><code>region</code>: marketing region (NA, EU, APAC).</li>
  <li><code>platform</code>: primary play platform (PC, Console, Mobile).</li>
  <li><code>membership_tier</code>: monetization tier (Free, Standard, Premium).</li>
  <li><code>hours_per_week</code>: average hours spent playing per week.</li>
  <li><code>matches_per_week</code>: average number of matches played per week.</li>
  <li><code>in_game_spend</code>: average weekly in-game spend (USD).</li>
</ul>

<p>The multinomial regression can be used to understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How membership tier, platform, and region shift the odds of being Core or Competitive versus Casual.</li>
  <li>How marginal increases in time (<code>hours_per_week</code>, <code>matches_per_week</code>) change the probability of landing in each segment.</li>
  <li>Which combinations of predictors are most associated with higher-value Competitive players.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Try fitting the model with <strong>Competitive</strong> as the reference outcome, then switch to <strong>Casual</strong> as
the reference to see how the interpretation of coefficients changes while the underlying probabilities stay the same.
