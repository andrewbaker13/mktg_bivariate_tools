# Title
EDM Event Spend: Lead Time, Ticket Type, and Revenue Per Patron

# Description
<p>
You are the marketing analyst for a live events company that runs electronic dance music (EDM) shows in several major cities. The team wants to understand what drives <strong>total event spend per patron</strong> (tickets, drinks, and on-site merch) so they can forecast revenue and design better offers.
</p>
<p>
For a recent tour, you pulled transaction-level data and aggregated it to the patron level. For each attendee, you have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>event_spend:</strong> total on-site spend in USD (tickets + ancillary revenue).</li>
  <li><strong>days_preordered:</strong> how many days before the event their first ticket was purchased (lead time).</li>
  <li><strong>type:</strong> ticket class for their first purchase (<em>VIP</em>, <em>Early_Bird</em>, <em>General_Admission</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The relationship between lead time, ticket type, and spend is realistic but noisy: VIP patrons often spend more, but not always; early-bird buyers tend to plan further ahead; some last-minute GA buyers still end up spending a lot on drinks. This scenario is deliberately built to avoid “perfect” patterns so students practice interpreting partial, messy associations that are common in real event marketing data.
</p>
<p>
Your goal is to use multiple linear regression to quantify how much extra revenue the team can expect from different ticket types and from longer lead times, while holding the other predictor constant. You will also assess whether these relationships are strong and stable enough to use in forecasting and budget planning.
</p>

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Set up the model:</strong> Use <em>event_spend</em> as the outcome and include <em>days_preordered</em> and <em>type</em> as predictors, treating <em>type</em> as categorical.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret coefficients:</strong> Translate the VIP and Early_Bird coefficients into estimated differences in event spend relative to General_Admission, controlling for lead time. Interpret the lead-time coefficient as additional expected spend per extra day of pre-order.</li>
  <li><strong>Check diagnostics:</strong> Use R-squared, residual plots, and influential points to explain why the model is useful but not perfect, and to identify weeks or segments where performance deviates from the trend.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect to strategy:</strong> Turn the regression output into recommendations about inventory, pricing windows, and VIP package design for upcoming shows.</li>
</ul>
