# Title
Four-brand choice (Brand A / B / C / D)

# Description
<p><strong>Scenario 2 &mdash; Multi-brand preference.</strong> A category manager is analyzing preference for four
competing brands (A, B, C, and D) in a mature market. Each row represents one respondent who has indicated a
single most-preferred brand, along with their self-reported price sensitivity (Low / Medium / High), age band,
and the primary channel through which they interact with the category (Email, Search, or Social).</p>
<p>The outcome <code>brand_choice</code> is modeled as a multinomial variable with four categories. The predictors
<code>price_sensitivity</code>, <code>age_band</code>, and <code>channel</code> capture segments where different
brands tend to do better. For example, Brand A tends to over-index among more price-sensitive segments, while
Brand C is more common among respondents reporting High price sensitivity and certain age bands. These patterns
are present but not deterministic; there is intentionally some overlap and noise so that estimated effects are
realistic rather than perfect.</p>
<p>Marketing analytics students can use this scenario to practice interpreting multinomial logistic coefficients
as log-odds and to translate those coefficients into predicted probabilities for each brand. Consider questions
like: which segments are most likely to choose Brand B vs Brand A, and how does that change if you shift
price sensitivity or the primary channel?</p>

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select the scenario:</strong> Choose the four-brand choice case from the scenario menu to auto-load the
  sample dataset and description.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose an outcome:</strong> Use <code>brand_choice</code> as the multinomial outcome (Brand A, B, C, D).</li>
  <li><strong>Pick predictors:</strong> Include <code>price_sensitivity</code>, <code>age_band</code>, and
  <code>channel</code> as predictors. Experiment with different reference brands to see how the log-odds and relative
  probabilities change.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret segments:</strong> Use the coefficient table and predicted probability plots to understand which
  combinations of price sensitivity, age band, and channel are most likely to choose each brand.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect to strategy:</strong> Translate the model into targeting ideas, such as which segments are
  vulnerable to switching or where a specific brand has the strongest competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
