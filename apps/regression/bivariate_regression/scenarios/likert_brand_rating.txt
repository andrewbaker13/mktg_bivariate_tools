# Title
Social Content Reaction vs. Brand Favorability

# Description
<p>
Your team has just run a social media concept test for a new campaign. Followers were shown a series of Instagram and TikTok posts built around a fresh creative platform. After viewing the content, a sample of followers rated their <strong>reaction to the content</strong> on a 1–5 Likert scale (“Strongly Dislike” to “Strongly Like”) and then rated their <strong>overall favorability toward the brand</strong> on a 0–100 scale.
</p>
<p>
The dataset includes roughly ten respondents at each Likert level, with plenty of overlap across brand favorability scores. Some people “like” the content but still give middling brand scores; others are lukewarm on the content but have strong baseline affinity for the brand. This is deliberate: in real campaigns, content reactions and brand attitudes are related, but far from perfectly tied together.
</p>
<p>
As a marketing analyst, your job is to evaluate whether more positive reactions to the creative are associated with meaningfully higher brand favorability. You also want to demonstrate how the choice of modeling approach—treating the Likert scores as <em>continuous</em> vs. <em>categorical</em>—changes the story you tell to stakeholders.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start in continuous mode:</strong> Treat the 1–5 reaction scale as numeric and interpret the slope as the average change in brand favorability for each one-point increase in content reaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Switch to categorical mode:</strong> Re-run the model treating each reaction level as its own group with a reference category (e.g., “3 = Neutral”). Compare the pattern of group means and intervals.</li>
  <li><strong>Compare interpretations:</strong> Discuss how the continuous vs. categorical lens might support different recommendations (e.g., “we just need to shift people one point up” vs. “we must avoid strongly negative reactions at all costs”).</li>
  <li><strong>Connect to creative strategy:</strong> Use the results to argue for iteration on concepts that drive stronger emotional reactions while still aligning with the broader brand platform.</li>
</ul>
