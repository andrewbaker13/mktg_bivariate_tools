# Title
Character Level Predicts Gold Earned Per Quest

# Description
<p>
Your adventuring party has completed fifty quests over the past year, and the party treasurer has meticulously tracked two key variables for each quest: the <strong>average character level</strong> of party members and the <strong>total gold earned</strong> from quest rewards, treasure hoards, and enemy loot.
</p>
<p>
The party leader keeps asking: <em>"If we level up and take on higher-tier quests, how much more gold should we expect to earn per adventure?"</em> Some party members recall a few lucrative high-level quests and assume the relationship is linear and strong. Others remember disappointing hauls from difficult dungeons and worry that higher level doesn't guarantee better rewards.
</p>
<p>
To move beyond anecdotes and gut feelings, you decide to fit a bivariate regression model with <strong>Gold Earned</strong> (outcome, Y) predicted by <strong>Character Level</strong> (predictor, X). The data are intentionally realistic: some same-level quests produce very different gold amounts (maybe one dragon hoarded more treasure, or the party rolled poorly on loot tables), and occasionally a lower-level quest surprises everyone with an unexpected treasure cache.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to estimate the <strong>marginal effect of character level on gold earnings</strong> and quantify the uncertainty around that relationship. Rather than claiming "every level gives you exactly X gold more," you want to communicate a realistic range that accounts for the inherent randomness of quest rewards, party performance, and dice rolls.
</p>

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fit the regression:</strong> Treat character level as the predictor (X) and gold earned as the outcome (Y). The slope tells you the estimated increase in gold per level gained.</li>
  <li><strong>Examine confidence intervals:</strong> Use the CI around the slope to describe a plausible range of gold-per-level, acknowledging that some quests are more lucrative than others.</li>
  <li><strong>Check R-squared and residuals:</strong> These help explain why character level matters but isn't the <em>only</em> factor—quest difficulty, party composition, and random treasure generation all play roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Translate to planning:</strong> Communicate the results in adventurer language: "For each level we gain, we can expect approximately X to Y more gold per quest, on average. This helps us plan for major purchases like magical items or stronghold upgrades."</li>
</ul>
