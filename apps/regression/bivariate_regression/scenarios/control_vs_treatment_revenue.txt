# Title
Four-Segment Email Campaign

# Description
A lifecycle team is evaluating four email segments (A, B, C, D) on revenue per user. Each row in the dataset is one user with their segment label and observed revenue.

Segment A represents a broad prospect list, Segment B is a retargeting pool, Segment C is a low-intent interest group, and Segment D is a high-intent loyalty group. The file contains 200+ users so you can practice reading group means, confidence intervals, and reference coding in a regression framework.

Use this preset with the raw-data upload or manual-entry mode to practice interpreting categorical predictors with more than two levels.
