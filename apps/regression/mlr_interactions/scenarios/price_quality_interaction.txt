# Title
Price × Perceived Quality Interaction on Purchase Intent

# Description
<div class="scenario-description">
  <p>
    A consumer psychology study investigated how <strong>price and perceived quality interact</strong> to drive purchase intent. Classic pricing theory suggests that higher prices signal higher quality, but this relationship may be <em>moderated</em> by actual perceived quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    You surveyed 180 consumers, showing them product descriptions that varied systematically in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase Intent</strong> (outcome, 1-10 scale)</li>
    <li><strong>Price Point</strong> (continuous predictor, $20-$200)</li>
    <li><strong>Perceived Quality Rating</strong> (continuous predictor, 1-10 scale from user reviews)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The research question is whether the effect of price on purchase intent <strong>depends on</strong> perceived quality. For low-quality products, higher prices may deter purchase. For high-quality products, higher prices may enhance perceived value (prestige effect). This is a <strong>moderation hypothesis</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you'll learn:</strong> This scenario demonstrates a <strong>continuous × continuous interaction</strong>. The interaction term tests whether the slope of price changes at different levels of perceived quality. If significant, it means price elasticity is not constant—it varies with quality perceptions. This has major implications for pricing strategy.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select interaction type:</strong> Choose "Continuous × Continuous interaction"</li>
  <li><strong>Assign variables:</strong> Focal = price, Moderator = quality (or vice versa to see different perspectives)</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret the plot:</strong> Three lines show price effects at low quality (-1SD), average quality (mean), and high quality (+1SD)</li>
  <li><strong>Test simple slopes:</strong> Check if the price effect is significant at each quality level</li>
  <li><strong>Business implication:</strong> Price strategy should account for quality positioning</li>
</ul>
