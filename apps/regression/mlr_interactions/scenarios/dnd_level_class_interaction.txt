# Title
D&D: Character Level × Class Type Interaction on Damage Output

# Description
<div class="scenario-description">
  <p>
    Your adventuring party is engaged in a spirited tavern debate: <strong>do different character classes scale differently with level?</strong> The fighter claims that martial classes gain damage linearly with level, while the wizard insists that spellcasters have exponential damage growth due to higher-level spell slots.
  </p>
  <p>
    To settle this with data instead of dice-fueled arguments, your party's chronicler compiled combat logs from 120 encounters across multiple campaigns, tracking:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Average Damage Per Round</strong> (outcome, numeric)</li>
    <li><strong>Character Level</strong> (continuous predictor, 1-20)</li>
    <li><strong>Class Type</strong> (categorical predictor: Fighter, Wizard, Rogue)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The key question is whether the <strong>relationship between level and damage differs by class</strong>. In statistical terms: is there an interaction effect? Do fighters gain a consistent +2 damage per level, while wizards might gain +1 damage at low levels but +5 at high levels (once Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Meteor Swarm come online)?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you'll learn:</strong> This scenario demonstrates a <strong>continuous × categorical interaction</strong> in a gaming context. The interaction term allows the "level slope" to vary by class. If significant, it means some classes benefit more from leveling than others. This insight can inform party composition for different campaign level ranges and help players understand when their class "comes online" for maximum effectiveness.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Select interaction type:</strong> Choose "Continuous × Categorical interaction"</li>
  <li><strong>Assign variables:</strong> Focal = level, Moderator = class_type (or swap to see different perspective)</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret the plot:</strong> Separate lines for each class show how damage scales with level</li>
  <li><strong>Check the interaction coefficient:</strong> Tests whether level slopes differ significantly across classes</li>
  <li><strong>Adventuring implication:</strong> Understand which classes are strong early-game vs late-game; plan multi-classing accordingly</li>
</ul>
