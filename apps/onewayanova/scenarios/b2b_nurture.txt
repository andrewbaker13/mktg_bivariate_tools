# Title
B2B Nurture Content Tracks

# Description
A SaaS demand team is resurrecting a massive pool of dormant enterprise leads. Two nurture “worlds” are live: the Tutorial Deep Dive series that drip-feeds hands-on product walkthroughs, and an Executive ROI story track that delivers board-level business cases to economic buyers. Each track reports qualified pipeline dollars created per contacted lead, segmented across six verticals with different buying committees.

Sales leadership wants evidence on whether helpful, how-to content actually carries prospects further than inspirational ROI stories, or if senior decision makers need an executive tone to re-engage. Load this preset to see which track is reshaping the overall mean before the next two quarters of nurture creative are funded.
