Flagship Retail Promotions Matrix

# Description
The flagship apparel chain is rewriting its in-store promotions calendar ahead of peak back-to-school traffic. Four regional clusters are piloting wildly different discount philosophies: a dependable 15% off message to build trust, a tiered ladder that deepens discounts on high-margin assortments, sporadic flash-sale weekends built for urgency, and a loyalty bundle that pairs lighter discounts with app-exclusive perks. Each cluster reports weekly gross-margin dollars per store, adjusted for traffic and staffing.

Merchandising leaders are debating whether “steady Eddie” pricing protects perception, while the loyalty team argues that bundling perks keeps high-value shoppers engaged. This preset loads the observed results so you can measure how each storyline pulls on the grand mean before committing to one playbook for 1,200 stores.
