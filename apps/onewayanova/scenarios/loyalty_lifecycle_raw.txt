# Title
Lifecycle Messaging Experiment (Raw Observations)

# Description
Lifecycle marketing wants to understand which message style keeps high-value customers re-engaged after their first subscription renewal. Four variants are in market: an always-on thank-you note, a tiered loyalty story, a carousel of rotating benefits, and a hype-driven VIP drop invite. Each observation below is an incremental revenue-per-customer figure captured after the push notification and follow-up email hit. Use the raw dataset to stress-test your ingestion flows, flip into the raw upload mode, or stick with the summary statistics computed from the same rows.
