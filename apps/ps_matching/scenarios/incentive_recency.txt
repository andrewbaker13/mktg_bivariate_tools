# Title
Promo Landing Page: Incentive Strength and Visit Recency

# Description
<p>
You are analyzing a digital promotion for a retail brand that drives traffic to a limited-time offer landing page. Visitors may or may not see a <strong>high-incentive offer</strong> (for example, 25% off plus free shipping) depending on an A/B test. Marketing leadership wants to understand how strongly this richer incentive changes the <strong>probability of conversion</strong> and whether it is still worth running for visitors who have not been to the site recently.
</p>
<p>
For each unique visitor in the test, you have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Converted:</strong> binary indicator (1 = completed the promo goal such as email sign-up or first order; 0 = no conversion during the visit).</li>
  <li><strong>High_Incentive:</strong> 1 if the visitor saw the high-incentive variation of the promo, 0 if they saw the standard offer.</li>
  <li><strong>Days_Since_Last_Visit:</strong> number of days since the visitor last came to the site before this promo impression.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The data are intentionally realistic and somewhat noisy. Visitors who see the high-incentive promo convert at a meaningfully higher rate on average, but not perfectly: some still do not respond. For the standard offer, a smaller fraction of visitors convert, though a few still do so without the richer incentive. The variable <em>Days_Since_Last_Visit</em> is included as a potential control but was not strongly related to conversion in this campaign; in this dataset it may show a slightly negative coefficient that is <strong>not statistically significant</strong>, reflecting weak and noisy evidence that very stale visitors are a bit less likely to respond.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use <strong>logistic regression</strong> to model the probability of conversion (<code>Converted = 1</code>) as a function of whether the visitor saw the high-incentive promo and their visit recency. You should find one clearly positive and statistically reliable effect (the high incentive) and one small, non-significant negative effect (days since last visit), which is typical in real marketing experiments where one lever matters a lot and others matter only modestly or not at all.

# How to use
<ul>
  <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> set <em>Converted</em> as the binary outcome (1 = converted, 0 = did not convert).</li>
  <li><strong>Predictors:</strong> include <em>High_Incentive</em> (numeric 0/1) and <em>Days_Since_Last_Visit</em> (numeric) as predictors.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret coefficients:</strong> focus on how much the high-incentive promo multiplies the odds of conversion and changes the predicted conversion probability, holding visit recency constant.</li>
  <li><strong>Assess the negative predictor:</strong> interpret the <em>Days_Since_Last_Visit</em> coefficient and its p-value; explain why a small, non-significant negative estimate is common in practice and should be interpreted cautiously.</li>
  <li><strong>Connect to strategy:</strong> discuss whether the incremental lift from the high incentive appears strong enough to justify its cost and whether there is any compelling evidence to tailor the offer by recency segment.</li>
</ul>
