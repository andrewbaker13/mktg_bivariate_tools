# Title
Holiday Email Subject Lines and Click Behavior

# Description
<p>
You are working with the CRM team on a holiday campaign for an ecommerce brand. The team wants to understand whether the style of the email subject line influences click behavior during a crowded promotional period. Two variants are in market:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Utility-first subject line:</strong> focuses on specific benefits and savings (e.g., “Free Shipping + 20% Off Gifts Under $50”).</li>
  <li><strong>Story-driven subject line:</strong> leans into narrative and emotion (e.g., “How Our Customers Celebrate the Holidays”).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Over the course of the test, a large sample of subscribers received one of the two subject lines. For each send, you record whether the recipient <strong>clicked</strong> or <strong>did not click</strong>. The observed counts show a real but not dramatic difference between the two subject lines, reflecting the reality that subject line tests rarely create massive swings in behavior on their own.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a chi-square test of independence to determine whether click behavior is associated with subject line style. The test will help you move beyond gut feel (“benefits always win” vs. “stories break through clutter”) to a probabilistic statement about whether the observed difference is likely due to chance or indicates a real pattern in user engagement.
