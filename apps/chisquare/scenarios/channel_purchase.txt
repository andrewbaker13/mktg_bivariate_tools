# Title
Acquisition Channel vs. Purchase Behavior

# Description
<p>
You are supporting the performance marketing team for a retail brand that acquires new visitors through three main channels: <strong>email nurture</strong>, <strong>paid search</strong>, and <strong>organic social</strong>. The team wants to understand whether the mix of outcomes—people who purchase vs. people who only browse—differs by acquisition channel.
</p>
<p>
For a recent campaign, each new visitor is tagged with the channel that brought them in, and their immediate behavior is classified as either <em>Purchase</em> or <em>Browse only</em>. The resulting contingency table shows realistic, non-extreme differences: paid search appears to convert slightly better than organic social, email nurture sits somewhere in between, and all channels still produce a sizable share of non-purchasing browsers.
</p>
<p>
Your analytical goal is to use a chi-square test of independence to determine whether purchase vs. browse behavior is associated with acquisition channel. Rather than focusing only on conversion rates in isolation, this test helps you evaluate whether the overall pattern of behavior (purchase vs. browse) differs across channels in a way that is unlikely to be due to random variation alone.
